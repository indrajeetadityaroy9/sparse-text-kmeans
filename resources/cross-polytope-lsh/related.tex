\subsection{Related work}
The cross-polytope LSH functions were originally proposed in~\cite{terasawa2007spherical}. However, the analysis in that paper was mostly experimental. Specifically, the probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$ of the proposed LSH functions were estimated empirically using the Monte Carlo method. Similar hash functions were later proposed in~\cite{eshghi2008locality}. The latter paper also uses DFT to speed-up the random matrix-vector matrix multiplication operation. Both of the aforementioned papers consider only the {\em single-probe} algorithm.

There are several works that show lower bounds on the quality of LSH hash functions~\cite{motwani2007lower,Dubiner,o2014optimal,ar15lower}. However, those papers provide only a lower bound on the  $\rho$ parameter for asymptotic values of $p_1$ and $p_2$, as opposed to an actual trade-off between these two quantities. In this paper we provide such a trade-off, with implications as outlined in the introduction.
